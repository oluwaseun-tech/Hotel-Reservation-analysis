# Hotel-Reservation-analysis:

This project is a hotel reservation analysis in Tableau and SQL. This project uses SQL to analyze hotel reservation data and Tableau to create visualizations. The purpose is to acquire insight into occupancy rates, revenue patterns, and guest demographics to provide relevant information to hotel management.

This project analyzes hotel reservation data with SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization. The dataset contains data about reservations, guests, hotel kinds, and other pertinent information.


**CODE STRUCTURE:**

The code is structured as follows: SQL queries: The SQL queries shown here provide an overview of the data and other areas of hotel reservation analysis, such as cancellation analysis, customer segmentation, and guest type. Tableau Visualizations: This section looks at Tableau's interactive visualizations. Monthly revenue trends, occupancy rates, and guest demographics are all displayed visually.

**INSIGHTS:**

The analysis provided several insights:

Weekday occupancy rates differ from weekends, indicating the prospective client type. Understanding guest demographics can help target marketing initiatives.


**FUTURE WORK:**

Future improvements and analyses may include:

Predictive modeling for upcoming reservations. We combine external elements (such as vacations and events) into the study and create a real-time dashboard for dynamic monitoring.
